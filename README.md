### Heart Disease Research Part II
In this project, you’ll investigate some data from a sample patients who were evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis. The principal investigators responsible for data collection were:

* Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
* University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
* University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
* V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

Finally, we ask you to both print results and graph results in this project. Sometimes the printouts are formatted in a way that is difficult to read — feel free to expand the middle segment to make your printouts more readable.
